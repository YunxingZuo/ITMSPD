        ITMSPD (Intelligent Toolkits for Materials Structures and Properties Discovery) 
    is an open source Python package under development whose purpose is to provide
    the materials research community with high-efficient search algorithms for 
    discovery of new crystal structure in given compositions as well as preparing 
    different representations of a material and machine learning algorithms for 
    further investigation of structure-properties relationships in materials.

    and space groups as publicized in the open-source Python library Pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics).
